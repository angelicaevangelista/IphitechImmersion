First Asia Institute of Technology and Humanities 
As a faculty member, my goal is to help students succeed in their learning journey. I aim to provide a supportive and engaging learning environment where students feel motivated to actively participate and grow academically. My objective is to simplify complex concepts, break them down into understandable parts, and guide students in grasping and applying the knowledge effectively. I strive to foster a sense of curiosity, critical thinking, and a thirst for continuous learning among my students. Ultimately, I aspire to empower them with the skills and confidence they need to achieve their educational goals and excel in their chosen fields.
